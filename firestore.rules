    /**
     * Core Philosophy:
     * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can create
     * and manage their own profile and recruitment applications, but they cannot
     * view, edit, or delete data belonging to other users. There is no concept
     * of a global "admin" role defined in these rules; access is determined
     * solely by matching the authenticated user's ID against ownership fields
     * within the documents.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * The data is organized into two primary top-level collections:
     * 1. /users/{userId}: Stores minimal, private user profile data.
     * 2. /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/recruitment_applications/{appId}:
     *    A namespaced collection holding all recruitment applications.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents in the top-level /users
     *   collection is explicitly forbidden to prevent attackers from harvesting
     *   a list of all user IDs.
     * - Strict Application Privacy: Recruitment applications are private. A user
     *   can only read or list their own applications. While the original design
     *   reasoning mentioned a UI-based admin toggle, this cannot be securely
     *   enforced in the rules without a corresponding role system in the
     *   database. Therefore, a more secure default of strict ownership is enforced.
     * - Default Deny: All operations are denied by default and must be
     *   explicitly granted by a rule.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * To ensure fast and secure access control, each 'RecruitmentApplication'
     * document contains a denormalized `userId` field. This allows rules to
     * verify ownership with a simple field check, avoiding slow and costly `get()`
     * calls to other documents.
     *
     * Structural Segregation:
     * The separation of user profiles (`/users`) from application data
     * (`/artifacts/.../recruitment_applications`) provides a clean security
     * boundary, allowing for distinct and simple rules for each data type.
